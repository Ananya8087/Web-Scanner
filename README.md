# Web-Scanner
This Python-based web scanner is a versatile tool designed to help users identify vulnerabilities and potential security threats in their websites.The scanner integrates multiple modules, including nmap, robots_txt, and whois, to provide comprehensive scanning capabilities.

Nmap is used to identify open ports and services on the target website, enabling users to identify any potential entry points for attackers.

The robots_txt module is then used to check the website's robots.txt file, identifying any areas that are intentionally hidden from search engines. 

Finally, the whois module is used to gather information which are useful for a variety of purposes, such as checking domain availability, verifying domain ownership, investigating domain-related issues, and researching potential cyber threats.

The scanner is easy to use, with a simple command-line interface and intuitive options for specifying the target website and scan parameters. Results are presented in a separate directory with the company name and each file with module info of the company.
